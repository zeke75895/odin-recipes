    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pesto pasta is a quick, flavorful dish perfect for busy weeknights, ready in just 
        15 minutes. Made with your choice of pasta, a rich basil pesto sauce, and topped 
        with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, this recipe is both simple and satisfying. 
        Sautéed onions add depth of flavor, while salt and pepper enhance the vibrant 
        taste of the pesto. Easily customizable, you can add proteins like chicken, 
        sausage, or chickpeas, or serve it alongside crusty bread, a crisp Caesar salad, 
        or balsamic bruschetta for a complete meal.

        Praise from the Allrecipes community highlights its versatility—many reviewers suggest 
        doubling the sauce or adding extras like garlic, cherry tomatoes, or feta cheese 
        for extra flair. Whether you stick to the basics or get creative with mix-ins, 
        this pesto pasta is a reliable go-to for a delicious, fuss-free dinner. Leftovers 
        store well in the fridge for up to five days, making it a great option for meal 
        prep. Quick, easy, and packed with fresh flavors, it’s no wonder this dish is a 
        favorite among home cooks.</p>
