    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Classic macaroni salad is a creamy, flavorful side dish perfect for picnics, 
        potlucks, and barbecues. Made with tender macaroni, crisp celery, onion, and 
        bell pepper, this recipe gets its rich taste from a tangy-sweet dressing of 
        mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, and a touch of sugar. Optional add-ins like 
        grated carrots and pimentos bring extra color and texture, while simple 
        seasonings like salt and pepper let the fresh ingredients shine. Best when 
        chilled for at least four hours—or even made a day ahead—this salad allows 
        the flavors to meld beautifully, making it a reliable crowd-pleaser.

        Praise from home cooks highlights its versatility, with many adjusting the 
        sugar, swapping seasonings, or skipping certain veggies to suit their tastes. 
        Whether served alongside grilled favorites or as a standout dish at family 
        gatherings, this macaroni salad is so beloved that some reviewers joke about 
        being asked to bring it to every event. Stored properly, it stays fresh in the 
        fridge for up to five days—though it’s so delicious, it rarely lasts that long!</p>
